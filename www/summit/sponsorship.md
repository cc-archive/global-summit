The Creative Commons Global Summit is the signature, bi-annual
gathering of legal, technology, and academic professionals working to
support the growth and expansion of the Commons — free knowledge, open
culture, sharing and collaboration, in art, technology, education,
science, and more. A diverse group of professionals will collaborate
and celebrate over three days to advance the cause of the public
commons for all.

## The opportunity right now

There are nearly one billion CC licensed works hosted on some of the
most popular content platforms in the world (including Vimeo, YouTube,
Flickr, Wikipedia, Soundcloud - and recently Medium, edX, and
Wattpad), and over 9 million individual websites.

Leaders in global education and government are now turning to CC
licensed textbooks as the central plank in their Open Educational
Resources (OER) strategies, eliminating or significantly lowering the
cost of education for learners.

Politicians and activists around the world are fighting to make
government data and publicly-funded academic research freely shareable
and accessible to increase innovation and discovery. Creative Commons
is at the center of this international, high-profile movement, and the
CC Global Summit is the essential gathering to show your support for
this movement.

Creative Commons is the globally-focused nonprofit organization
dedicated to making it easier for people to share their creative
works, and build upon the work of others, consistent with the rules of
copyright. Founded by Prof. Lawrence Lessig in 2001, Creative Commons
provides free licenses and other legal tools to give individuals and
organizations a simple, standardized way to grant copyright
permissions for creative work, ensure proper attribution, and allow
others to copy, distribute, and make use of those works.
